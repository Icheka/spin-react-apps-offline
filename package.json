  "description": "spin-react-apps-offline is a very light, very fast, offline project installer for React. It installs your node_modules packages and other necessary files for you without a connection to the Internet. It's also much faster than the traditional create-react-app. spin-react-apps-offline provides several templates for you to choose from. You can install a barebones React application, or install one with built-in TypeScript support, or one with pre-configured routes like Home and Authentication + React-Redux, Redux, React-Router-DOM, built-in Firebase configuration, etc.",
