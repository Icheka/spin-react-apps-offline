# spin-react-apps-offline
`spin-react-apps-offline` is a very light, very fast, offline project installer for React. It installs your node_modules packages and other necessary files for you without a connection to the Internet. It's also much faster than the traditional `create-react-app`. `spin-react-apps-offline` provides several templates for you to choose from. You can install a `barebones` React application, or install one with built-in `TypeScript` support, or one with `pre-configured routes` like Home and Authentication + React-Redux, Redux, React-Router-DOM, built-in Firebase configuration, etc.
